Actions: seems pretty self explanatory, theres really only three things you can do, buy(x number), sell(x number), hold

	-- x number should probably be based off of our certainty of a prediction. For example, if we are 80% certain our stock is about to fall, we might sell 80% of our stock. Or some such correlation, probably more complex...

States: So I'm thinking we want a multi dimensional state to include all our factors. 
	the things I've thought of so far =
		current stock price
		current compared to short term average of last x time
		current compared to long term average of last x time
		short term trend = (lightly smoothed?) derivative at point
		long term trend = (heavily smoothed?) derivative at point

Rewards: the portfolio value
